## Procedure

### Step 1: Make a repo called private:
Navigate to the repository section and add a private repo and name it private.
>[!TIP]
>Adding the repo as a **PRIVATE** repo prevents people from knowing that this is going on
>In short **MIND YOUR SECRECY**


## Step 2: Add a file called data.txt in the repo:
At the top of your repo  where you usually add files create a file named **data.txt** with nothing in it.



## Step 3: Clone your repo in your local machine:
 Copy the command below and **REPLACE YOUR_USERNAME WITH YOUR USERNAME in github**
 - This creates a folder called **private** in your machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/private.git
```


>[!WARNING]
>For this command to work you will **HAVE TO REPLACE THE 'YOUR_USERNAME'** part in the url above with your github user name ie data-spice (<--- my username ) after replacing the user name the url should now contain your user name ie **git clone https://github.com/data-spice/private.git**




## Step 4: Download the main.py folder in this repo and move it into the private folder.

After this we will need to run the script and it must be in the folder.




### Step 5: Ensure python is installed
Verify the installation by running the following in your terminal
```
python --version
```



### Step 6: Navigate back to the private folder in terminal 

```
cd private
```

### Step 7: Run the python file:

> [!CAUTION]
> After running the python file add the number of contributions you want to add then continously press **enter** without typing anything in the proceeding fields.



>[!TIP]
> **If you find it hard to navigate back to the folder:**
> - Use ```ls``` or ```dir``` command to list items in the folder
> - Use ```cd folder_name``` command to change the folder. Replace **folder_name** with the folder you want to switch to.
> - If you already know the full path to the folder use ```cd path_to_privatefolder``` to get to the folder. Replace **path_to_privatefolder** with the path.
> Enter a logical number of commits in accordance to you repo to preserve authenticity.ie
